   * Validate self-termination (logical removal) of a community membership and
   * re-join ability.
   *
   * Steps:
   *
   * 1. Join as a community member (authentication) â†’ token is set by SDK
   * 2. Create a community (requires category fixture id)
   * 3. Join the community (create membership)
   * 4. Leave the community (erase membership)
   * 5. Re-join the community (create membership again)
   *
   * Notes:
   *
   * - No roster/list API is provided, so we validate by ensuring erase completes
   *   and re-join succeeds.
   * - For re-join: either the same membership row is reactivated or a new row is
   *   created; both policies are accepted.
