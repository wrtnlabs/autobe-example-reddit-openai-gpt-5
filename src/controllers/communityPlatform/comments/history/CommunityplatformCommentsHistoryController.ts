  /**
   * List comment history snapshots (community_platform_comment_snapshots) for a
   * comment.
   *
   * Retrieve the version history entries for a single comment identified by
   * {commentId}. The community_platform_comment_snapshots model is documented
   * as historical point-in-time records capturing the content state of
   * community_platform_comments. Records are created whenever content changes
   * to preserve audit trails and enable version review. Each snapshot stores
   * the content at that time, the parent_id at that moment (if any), and the
   * snapshot timestamps.
   *
   * Security and access: This endpoint is read-only and intended for displaying
   * historical context. Implementers should enforce business rules around who
   * can view history consistent with product policy. The operation returns only
   * records that remain in active views (for example, those without a
   * deleted_at value), and it never modifies comment or snapshot data.
   *
   * Database relationships: Each snapshot belongs to exactly one comment via
   * community_platform_comment_id, which must match the {commentId} path
   * parameter. The source comment itself references a post and an author in
   * community_platform_comments. This operation should filter by
   * community_platform_comment_id and order snapshots by created_at descending
   * by default, using canonical tie-breakers when necessary.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: The request body
   * (ICommunityPlatformCommentSnapshot.IRequest) supports pagination
   * (page/limit or cursor), optional filtering by created_at ranges, and
   * sorting (commonly by created_at). Snapshot text is plain text as per the
   * comment rules, and the response should adhere to privacy rules (for
   * example, visibility of removed content) without exposing internal-only
   * data.
   *
   * Related endpoints: Use GET /comments/{commentId}/history/{historyId} to
   * retrieve a single snapshot’s full detail. Clients typically call this
   * listing first, then fetch a selected snapshot by its identifier.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param commentId Unique identifier of the target comment whose history is
   *   requested
   * @param body Search, filter, sort, and pagination parameters for listing
   *   comment snapshots

  /**
   * Get a specific comment snapshot (community_platform_comment_snapshots) by

   *
   * Return a single point-in-time snapshot for the comment specified by
   * {commentId}. The community_platform_comment_snapshots schema stores
   * append-only-like records that capture the state of a comment when a change
   * occurred. Each snapshot contains the plain-text content at that moment, the
   * then-current parent_id (if any), and the created_at timestamp for accurate
   * historical ordering.
   *
   * Security and access: This read operation surfaces historical content for
   * audit/version viewing. Implement authorization consistent with product
   * policy. The operation should not include records that are removed from
   * active views (those with a non-null deleted_at), and it performs no data
   * modification.
   *
   * Database relationships and constraints: The snapshot belongs to the comment
   * referred to by the path parameter {commentId} through
   * community_platform_comment_id, and the targeted snapshot is identified by
   * {historyId}. Implementers should verify both IDs and ensure the snapshot’s
   * community_platform_comment_id matches the supplied commentId to avoid
   * cross-resource leakage.
   *
   * Validation and error handling: If the snapshot is not found, or does not
   * belong to the specified comment, return a suitable not-found or
   * authorization error as appropriate. This endpoint complements the listing
   * endpoint (PATCH /comments/{commentId}/history) that supports pagination and
   * sorting.
