   * List/search application settings from Prisma table
   * community_platform_app_settings with pagination for admins.
   *
   * This operation lists configuration settings from the
   * community_platform_app_settings table for administrative review and
   * management scenarios. Per the Prisma schema comments, this table holds
   * key-value configuration entries that control platform behavior, including
   * feature flags and policy values. Each entry includes a unique key, a string
   * value (parsed by application logic), a value_type semantic hint, an
   * optional description, an active boolean, and lifecycle timestamps
   * (created_at, updated_at). Records with a non-null deleted_at are considered
   * removed from active views and should be excluded from normal listings.
   *
   * Security-wise, configuration data is sensitive and intended for platform
   * administrators. Only users with elevated privileges should access this
   * endpoint. The endpoint designates authorizationRoles to "systemAdmin" based
   * on the role assignment model community_platform_systemadmins, which
   * captures platform administrators via a dedicated assignment table.
   *
   * The request body ICommunityPlatformAppSetting.IRequest supports pagination
   * (page, limit), free-text search over key/description, filtering by active
   * and value_type, and sorting by created_at, updated_at, key, or
   * display-friendly fields. Sorting should allow ascending/descending control
   * and deterministic tie-breaking when values are equal. The response
   * IPageICommunityPlatformAppSetting.ISummary provides a stable page container
   * including pagination metadata and an array of summary items containing
   * essential fields such as id, key, value_type, active, and updated_at
   * suitable for list renderings.
   *
   * Related operations include retrieving an individual setting by id via GET
   * /appSettings/{appSettingId}. Administrative write operations
   * (create/update/delete) are intentionally not exposed here, aligning with
   * selective API surface principles unless explicitly required elsewhere.
   * Error handling should return appropriate authorization errors for non-admin
   * callers and support validation messages for malformed search/sort
   * parameters.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria, sorting, and pagination parameters for
   *   application settings.

  /**
   * Get a specific app setting (community_platform_app_settings) by ID for
   * admin inspection.
   *
   * This operation fetches one configuration record from
   * community_platform_app_settings using its primary key id (UUID). According
   * to the Prisma schema comments, the table stores platform-wide configuration
   * entries with a unique key, a string value, value_type (semantic hint),
   * optional description, an active flag, and created_at/updated_at timestamps.
   * Records where deleted_at is non-null are considered removed from active
   * use; typical implementations should not return such entries to standard
   * callers unless an audit context explicitly requires it.
   *
   * Access is restricted to platform administrators due to the sensitive nature
   * of configuration data. The authorization role aligns with the system
   * administrator assignment captured in community_platform_systemadmins. The
   * endpoint returns a detailed ICommunityPlatformAppSetting representation
   * suitable for admin detail views and subsequent decision-making.
   *
   * If the id does not correspond to an active configuration entry, the service
   * should respond with a not-found outcome. If the caller lacks sufficient
   * privileges, return an authorization error consistent with platform security
   * guidelines. This endpoint is typically used together with the list/search
   * endpoint PATCH /appSettings for navigation from a list to a detail view.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param appSettingId Unique identifier of the target application setting
   *   (UUID).
