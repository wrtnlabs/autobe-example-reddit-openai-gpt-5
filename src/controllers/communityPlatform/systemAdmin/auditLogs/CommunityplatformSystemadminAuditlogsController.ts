   * Search and paginate administrative audit logs

   *
   * This operation lists audit entries stored in the
   * community_platform_audit_logs table, which captures general-purpose,
   * append-only records of significant events, such as joins/leaves, content
   * creation/deletion, voting, authentication, and administrative actions. The
   * schema fields include actor_user_id, session_id, guestvisitor_id,
   * community_id, post_id, comment_id, membership_id, event_type, success,
   * details, ip, user_agent, and created_at/updated_at timestamps. Records use
   * deleted_at as a logical removal timestamp; list responses should exclude
   * records where deleted_at is not null unless an explicit administrative
   * retrieval mode is required.
   *
   * Security and authorization: Only users holding the systemAdmin role are
   * allowed to access this listing. The endpoint is strictly read-only and
   * intended for audit/compliance workflows. Requests should be rate-limited
   * and observable. The provider must ensure no sensitive tokens are exposed
   * (only internal identifiers and metadata logged in the audit table).
   *
   * Relationship context: Although the list originates from
   * community_platform_audit_logs, it may filter or enrich results using
   * relations to community_platform_users (actor), community_platform_sessions
   * (session correlation), community_platform_guestvisitors (unauthenticated
   * actor), community_platform_communities, community_platform_posts,
   * community_platform_comments, and community_platform_community_memberships
   * when those foreign keys are present. These relations are optional and
   * should be joined only when needed by filters or projection.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: Support filters on event_type (exact or
   * set), success flag, time windows using created_at range, and resource
   * scoping (e.g., by community_id, post_id, comment_id, membership_id).
   * Sorting defaults to created_at desc with a deterministic tiebreaker by id
   * when timestamps match. Pagination should be implemented to return
   * manageable pages for UI list rendering.
   *
   * Related operations: Use GET /auditLogs/{auditLogId} to retrieve full
   * details of a single audit record when an entry from this list is selected.
   * Errors should follow standard patterns; attempts by non-admins must be
   * denied with appropriate authorization handling.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search criteria, time-range, sorting, and pagination for audit
   *   log retrieval.

  /**
   * Get details of a single audit log (community_platform_audit_logs).
   *
   * This operation returns one immutable audit record from
   * community_platform_audit_logs identified by its primary key. The table
   * stores append-only snapshots of significant events. Columns include
   * actor_user_id, session_id, guestvisitor_id, community_id, post_id,
   * comment_id, membership_id, event_type, success, optional details, ip,
   * user_agent, and created_at/updated_at timestamps. Records with a non-null
   * deleted_at represent logically removed entries and should normally be
   * excluded unless an explicit admin retrieval mode is required.
   *
   * Security and permissions: Access is limited to users holding the
   * systemAdmin role. The response is for read-only investigative purposes; no
   * mutation is supported. Providers should avoid exposing sensitive secrets
   * while returning the metadata stored in the audit table.
   *
   * Relationships and context: The response may be resolved with optional
   * associations (actor user, session, guest visitor, and resource targets) for
   * context in admin tooling, but the canonical source is the
   * community_platform_audit_logs row selected by id.
   *
   * Error handling: If the identifier does not exist or the record has been
   * logically removed from active views, return a not-found outcome.
   * Unauthorized access attempts must be denied according to platform policy.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param auditLogId Unique identifier of the audit log record to retrieve.
