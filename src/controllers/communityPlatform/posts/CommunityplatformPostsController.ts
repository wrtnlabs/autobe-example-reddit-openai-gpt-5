   * Search and paginate post summaries from community_platform_posts using
   * deterministic Newest/Top ordering.
   *
   * This operation lists posts from community_platform_posts with advanced
   * search/sort capabilities aligned to the product’s deterministic rules. The
   * posts table stores the core fields (title, body, author_display_name,
   * created_at, updated_at) and references community_platform_communities and
   * community_platform_users via foreign keys. Trigram indexes on title and
   * body support efficient text matching when queries are provided. Sorting by
   * Newest must use the tuple (created_at desc, id desc). Sorting by Top
   * requires computing score as upvotes minus downvotes using
   * community_platform_post_votes and then applying the tie-breakers
   * (created_at desc, id desc) when scores are equal.
   *
   * Security considerations follow the platform’s read-open model: anyone can
   * read public posts without authentication. Implementations may still look up
   * the authenticated user to provide per-user signals like myVote, but
   * authorization is not required for basic listing. The endpoint is read-only
   * and does not modify data in any table. Business logic should exclude posts
   * that are not visible per product policies and maintain stable cursor
   * pagination across repeated requests.
   *
   * The request body ICommunityPlatformPost.IRequest typically includes
   * optional filters such as community name, a free-text query for title/body
   * matching, a sort parameter (newest or top), and pagination properties
   * (cursor, limit with a default of 20). The response
   * IPageICommunityPlatformPost.ISummary returns page-level metadata (e.g.,
   * next cursor) and a compact list of post summaries suitable for cards,
   * including fields like community name, title, author label, created
   * timestamp, derived score, and visible comment counts.
   *
   * Error handling covers invalid parameters (e.g., unsupported sort or
   * malformed cursor) and transient read failures. Providers should map short
   * queries to appropriate validation messages where search is enabled and
   * apply tie-breakers exactly as defined to avoid duplicates or gaps between
   * consecutive pages.
   *

   *   listing.

  /**
   * Get a single post (community_platform_posts) by UUID with score and comment
   * count.
   *
   * This operation retrieves one post from community_platform_posts identified
   * by its primary key id. The table defines author and community relationships
   * via foreign keys to community_platform_users and
   * community_platform_communities. Core columns include title, body, optional
   * author_display_name, created_at, and updated_at—used for detail display and
   * deterministic ordering in lists elsewhere.
   *
   * Security model is read-open: all users, including guests, may retrieve
   * public post content. Implementations may optionally tailor fields such as
   * the caller’s current vote state by consulting community_platform_post_votes
   * for the (post, user) pair. The provider computes score as upvotes minus
   * downvotes from community_platform_post_votes and counts visible comments
   * from community_platform_comments for display. If the post is not found or
   * not eligible for display, the provider returns a not-found outcome
   * consistent with platform rules.
   *
   * Error handling includes validation of the postId format (UUID), not-found
   * for missing records, and generic temporary error mapping when underlying
   * reads fail. This endpoint returns a full post representation
   * ICommunityPlatformPost to support Post Detail rendering, including nested
   * objects such as community basics and author label for UI use.
