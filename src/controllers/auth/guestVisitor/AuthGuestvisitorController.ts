  /**
   * Register guestVisitor in community_platform_users and create session in
   * community_platform_sessions.
   *
   * Purpose and scope: This endpoint registers a temporary guest identity and
   * issues a session for smooth resume-after-login experiences without full
   * member credentials. A new account is created in the Prisma model
   * Actors.community_platform_users using required columns email,
   * email_normalized, username, username_normalized, and password_hash, with
   * optional display_name and last_login_at set on successful issuance. The
   * account timestamps created_at and updated_at are recorded for audit and
   * ordering. No membership privilege rows are created; specifically,
   * Actors.community_platform_registeredmembers and
   * Actors.community_platform_siteadmins remain absent for this account.
   *
   * Implementation details: After creating the user row, the service persists a
   * session in Sessions.community_platform_sessions with a securely generated
   * hashed_token (plaintext never stored), an absolute expires_at to satisfy
   * long-lived session targets, and optional
   * user_agent/ip/client_platform/client_device metadata. Timestamps
   * created_at/updated_at are set, and last_seen_at is recorded or initialized.
   * The session is returned to the client through the authorized response
   * payload so the UI can proceed with guarded actions that require being
   * signed in as a guest identity (e.g., preparing to upgrade flow, resuming
   * blocked actions after prompt).
   *
   * Role-specific integration: The guestVisitor role indicates an
   * unauthenticated browsing state prior to registration. Upon guest join, the
   * user is represented by the newly created community_platform_users row but
   * remains a guest (not a registered member). No entries are inserted into
   * Actors.community_platform_registeredmembers or
   * Actors.community_platform_siteadmins. Content write permissions remain
   * restricted per product rules; however, the session enables long-lived
   * identity for resume-after-login behavior and state continuity.
   *
   * Security considerations: Credentials are not reused from other roles. The
   * system must honor uniqueness via email_normalized and username_normalized,
   * and store only password_hash. Session tokens are represented only by
   * community_platform_sessions.hashed_token, never plaintext. Session expiry
   * is controlled by community_platform_sessions.expires_at, with renewal
   * performed via the companion refresh endpoint for this role. Optionally,
   * last_login_at in community_platform_users can be set to the current
   * timestamp on successful issuance.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: Minimal validation should respect the
   * database constraints and uniqueness enforced by email_normalized and
   * username_normalized. The application may auto-generate ephemeral values to
   * satisfy required columns in Actors.community_platform_users when the client
   * does not provide them. On uniqueness conflicts, return a suitable error
   * according to service conventions. No soft deletion semantics are applied
   * during creation; deleted_at columns remain null.
   *
   * Related operations and workflow: This join operation is typically followed
   * by the refresh endpoint for token renewal
   * (Sessions.community_platform_sessions rotation/extension). There is no
   * login endpoint for the guestVisitor role by design. Upgrading to
   * member-level capabilities would be handled by separate role-specific flows
   * unrelated to this operation.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Guest join payload (ephemeral identity inputs or empty; server
   *   may auto-generate required fields).

  /**
   * Refresh guestVisitor session by rotating/updating
   * community_platform_sessions.
   *
   * Purpose and scope: This endpoint renews guestVisitor authentication by
   * refreshing a session represented in Prisma by
   * Sessions.community_platform_sessions. It validates the presented token
   * (e.g., via a provided refresh token or secure cookie mapped to
   * community_platform_sessions.hashed_token), ensures the session is not
   * revoked (revoked_at is null) and not expired beyond renewal policy, and
   * then rotates or extends the session by updating expires_at and
   * last_seen_at. The corresponding user record in
   * Actors.community_platform_users remains unchanged beyond an optional update
   * to last_login_at.
   *
   * Implementation details: A valid session row is required in
   * community_platform_sessions. On success, the endpoint may create a new
   * session record with a new hashed_token or update the existing one depending
   * on the rotation policy, always avoiding plaintext token storage. The
   * response returns an authorized structure that clients can use to continue
   * guarded flows after renewal. The actorâ€™s role remains guest; no rows are
   * created in Actors.community_platform_registeredmembers or
   * Actors.community_platform_siteadmins.
   *
   * Role-specific integration: This operation is specific to the guestVisitor
   * role and exists because kind is "guest". It complements the guest join flow
   * by extending long-lived sessions without requiring a member login. It must
   * enforce the association to Actors.community_platform_users via
   * community_platform_user_id, ensuring the user has not been deactivated
   * (e.g., users.deleted_at is null) prior to renewal.
   *
   * Security considerations: Validate that
   * community_platform_sessions.revoked_at is null and
   * community_platform_sessions.expires_at permits renewal. Always store only
   * the hashed token (community_platform_sessions.hashed_token). Update
   * last_seen_at to reflect the renewal activity, and set a new expires_at
   * within platform-defined bounds. Any invalid or expired token should result
   * in an appropriate unauthorized response per service conventions.
   *
   * Validation and business logic: The refresh request must supply sufficient
   * token context to locate the session (header/cookie or request body field).
   * The system must handle race conditions idempotently so the final state
   * contains exactly one active, non-revoked session for the guest account. No
   * soft deletion is performed by this operation; deleted_at columns remain
   * null.
   *
   * Related operations and workflow: Paired with the guestVisitor join
   * endpoint. There is no login for this role. Member/admin authentication
   * flows are separate and out of scope here.
