  /**
   * Register or correlate an anonymous visitor and issue initial guest JWT
   * using community_platform_guestvisitors.
   *
   * Purpose and functionality: This endpoint creates or reuses an anonymous
   * visitor identity based on client hints and issues initial JWT tokens for
   * the guest role. It is backed by the Prisma model
   * community_platform_guestvisitors which captures device_fingerprint,
   * user_agent, ip, and tracks first_seen_at and last_seen_at timestamps for
   * the same visitor. Unlike member or admin flows, there is no lookup in
   * community_platform_user_credentials and no community_platform_sessions row,
   * because the visitor is not an authenticated user account.
   *
   * Implementation details: On request, the provider will either create a new
   * row in community_platform_guestvisitors (initializing first_seen_at and
   * last_seen_at) or update last_seen_at when correlating by device_fingerprint
   * and/or other hints. The endpoint returns access/refresh tokens encapsulated
   * in the ICommunityPlatformGuestVisitor.IAuthorized DTO with expiry metadata.
   * The returned tokens enable guarded actions to trigger the “Please sign in
   * to continue.” prompt logic and smooth resume as specified in business
   * requirements.
   *
   * Role-specific integration and business context: The role is a guest
   * (non-authenticated), mapped to the guestVisitor capability in the PRD.
   * Guests can browse public content and search but cannot create posts,
   * comments, vote, or join/leave. This endpoint exists to start a resumable
   * session context for guarded flows without elevating to a member account.
   *
   * Security considerations: Since no password or email exists for guests,
   * identity correlation uses
   * community_platform_guestvisitors.device_fingerprint, user_agent, and ip
   * where available. Tokens should be short-lived and scoped for read-only
   * operations plus guarded-flow resumption, and the service should update
   * community_platform_guestvisitors.last_seen_at each use to support abuse
   * detection and analytics via community_platform_audit_logs.guestvisitor_id.
   *
   * Related operations and workflow: Use this join endpoint first for brand-new
   * visitors. Later, call /auth/guestVisitor/refresh to rotate tokens using a
   * valid refresh token. Member/admin authentication flows are intentionally
   * not exposed here because those map to community_platform_users plus
   * community_platform_user_credentials and community_platform_sessions, which
   * do not apply to guests.
   *
   * Error handling: Return standard authentication errors for malformed
   * payloads or server-side failures. If client hints are missing, still create
   * a minimal community_platform_guestvisitors row and proceed. Do not
   * reference soft deletion semantics in this operation; the guest record
   * lifecycle is independent of token lifetime.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Client-provided hints for correlating/creating an anonymous
   *   visitor (e.g., device fingerprint) and optional context.
   * @setHeader token.access Authorization

  /**
   * Refresh guest JWT tokens linked to community_platform_guestvisitors without
   * using user sessions.
   *
   * Purpose and functionality: This endpoint renews guest access by accepting a
   * valid refresh token and returning a fresh
   * ICommunityPlatformGuestVisitor.IAuthorized payload. The underlying visitor
   * identity is represented by community_platform_guestvisitors with fields
   * such as device_fingerprint, user_agent, ip, first_seen_at, and
   * last_seen_at.
   *
   * Implementation details: On successful refresh, the provider should validate
   * the presented guest refresh token, rotate tokens, and update
   * community_platform_guestvisitors.last_seen_at to the current time. Because
   * guests are not real accounts in community_platform_users and do not have
   * community_platform_user_credentials, no password checks or email
   * verification occurs here, and community_platform_sessions is not used for
   * guest flows.
   *
   * Role-specific integration and business context: Guests can continue
   * browsing and be seamlessly prompted to sign in when attempting guarded
   * actions. The refresh process aligns with generous session expectations and
   * smooth re-login behavior outlined in the PRD while remaining distinct from
   * member/admin session renewal.
   *
   * Security considerations: Enforce refresh token validation and expiry, and
   * scope issued access tokens appropriately for guest capabilities. Track ip
   * and user_agent where available to support anomaly detection and correlate
   * with the community_platform_guestvisitors record for analytics, and
   * optionally emit community_platform_audit_logs entries linked via
   * guestvisitor_id for observability.
   *
   * Related operations and workflow: Initial token issuance occurs at
   * /auth/guestVisitor/join. If the refresh token is invalid, expired, or
   * revoked, the client should call /auth/guestVisitor/join to obtain a new
   * token set. This endpoint is intentionally separate from member/admin
   * /auth/{role}/refresh flows that rely on community_platform_sessions.
   *
   * Error handling: Return appropriate authentication errors for
   * invalid/expired refresh tokens. Do not mention or rely on soft-deletion
   * behavior; token rotation is independent from any archival settings on guest
   * data.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Refresh request containing the current guest refresh token and
   *   optional client context.
   * @setHeader token.access Authorization
